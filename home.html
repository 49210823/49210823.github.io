    <div id="whatisfutsal">
        <h2>What is futsal? Why play it?</h2>

        <p>Futsal is a form of 5v5 soccer and is the only form of indoor soccer sanctioned by <a href"https://www.fifa.com/">FIFA</a> and <a href"https://www.ussoccer.com/">USSF</a>. It is played without boards on a hard surface using a special ball. Match play is governed by modified <a href"https://ussoccer.app.box.com/s/aw3k3q9umnlfqii792cb/file/742492294516">FIFA Futsal Laws of The Game</a>.</p>

        <p>The surface, ball and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. These factors combine to allow players to develop quick, confident touches, and make quick, confident decisions on and off the ball while playing a fast paced, exciting game.</p>
